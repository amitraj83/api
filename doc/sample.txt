{Buying a car is always tricky. | When you are going to buy a new car or used cars, taking the right decision is very complicated. | With so many cars in the market, its very difficult to find the best car for you.}
{In this blog, we will compare {car1}, {car2} and {car3}, and find out which one is good and why? | Today, we are going to compare {car1}, {car2} and {car3} to checkout which one suits best to your needs and why?| Lets compare {car1}, {car2} and {car3} and find out which car you should buy and why?}

{The criteria used to compare and rank the cars is | To compare and rank the cars, the criteia used are | Following criteria was used to compare and rank them to find the best car}

Bullet POints:
1. More the {criteria}, better it is. (Not at all important -1, Slightly important - 2, Important -3, Fairly Important -4, Very important -5) | Lesser the {criteria}, better it is.


For each criteria {
When we compare {criteria}, we found that {car1} has {criteria-value} {criteria}, {car2} has {criteria-value} {criteia} and {car3} has {criteria-value}{criteria}. |
Firstly, we are considering the criteria {criteria} of {car1}, {car2} and {car3} and they have {criteria-value} {criteia}, {criteria-value} {criteia} and {criteria-value} {criteia}, respectively. |
Lets review {criteria} of each car where {car1} has {criteria-value} {criteria}, {car2} has {criteria-value} {criteia} and {car3} has {criteria-value}{criteria}.

Because given preference is {lower the better}|{higher the better}, it comes out that {car with rank 1} is the best because it has {criteria} {criteria value} which {highest|lowest} from others. And because
you have mentioned that {criteria} is {Not at all important|...}, its {car with rank 1's} weighted rank is {weighted rank of car 1} where as weighted rank of {car with rank 2} is {weighted rank of car 2}
and weighted rank of {car with rank 3} is {weighted rank of car 3}.|
When we compared {criteria} of {car with rank 1} with that of others, we found that {car with rank 1} stands best. It is because the mentioned criteria {criteia} value is {highest if higher the better| lowest if lower the better}
as compared to that of {car with rank 2} and {car with rank 3}. Given that {criteria} is {faily important|....}, the weighted rank of {car with rank 1} is {rank of car 1} which is better than the weighted ranks of {cars with rank 2} and {cars with rank 3}.
|

}

In the end, we calculate the final rank of cars by adding all the weighted ranks of each criteria. So, finally, {car with rank 1} stands out to be the best one becuase your important 
criteria are best matched in this car. |
After evaluating all criteria among all cars, we found that {car with rank 1} seems to be the best suited for your needs as compared to {car with rank 2} and {car with rank 3}. |
In conclusion, our verdict is that the car {car with rank 1} is the best cars because it stands best when compared with other cars, according to your criteria.
